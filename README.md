## Overview

For  February to April, I tracked **everything I consumed**â€”every meal, sip of water, step, and even the smallest amount of calorie. This data has been transformed into an interactive **Streamlit app**: [Nutrify](https://bhautik-nutrify.streamlit.app/). ðŸ“ŠðŸ’ª

## Features

- **Data Visualization**: Interactive charts displaying daily calorie intake, calories burned, macros consumption, steps walked, and water intake.
- **See the Data**: You can download the actual dataset to explore detailed insights into dietary habits and fitness trends.
